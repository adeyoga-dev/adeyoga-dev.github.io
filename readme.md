# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adeyoga, a **Fullstack Web Developer** passionate about building clean and maintainable web applications.  
Currently, I work at a **manufacturing company that produces safety systems (like car airbags)**, where I develop digital solutions to improve efficiency and traceability.

ðŸ’» **Tech Stack**

-   Laravel (PHP)
-   HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   PostgreSQL
-   Server Administration (Linux Ubuntu, Docker, Python for Scrapping)

ðŸ›  **What I Do**

-   Write clean, readable, and maintainable code with the **DRY principle**
-   Develop applications based on real-world requirements through interviews and documentation
-   Build solutions such as **digitalized hardware plant checksheets for reporting**, **verification master part NG with scheduling**, and **preparation delivery with mobile scanner**

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**

-   Deliver applications that users love to use
-   Document every development process for better maintainability
-   Keep improving skills to solve real-world system challenges

ðŸ“‚ **Current Projects**

-   I'm currently building my **developer portfolio website** to showcase my projects, skills, and learning journey. Stay tuned â€” Iâ€™ll be sharing it soon here on GitHub! ðŸš€

-   At work, I'm developing a **Production Mapping Manpower System**:

    -   Visual map of production lines with **pin markers** representing manpower positions
    -   **Hover interaction** to display detailed manpower information
    -   **Color indicators** based on working hours for quick analysis of workload and efficiency

-   Iâ€™m also transitioning my previous **Asset Management Project** to a colleague:
    -   I initiated and led the project to the halfway point
    -   The system focuses on tracking and managing assets efficiently
    -   Now Iâ€™m mentoring and handing it over to ensure smooth continuation
